# Responsive_Blog_Page_Website
This Project is the first Task assigned to me during my Internship at Dabotics India Pvt. Ltd.

Here I build Responsive Coffee Landing page with the help of HTML , CSS and JS. 
Here I have used HTML for Page layout markup, CSS for improving styling and 
achieving Responsive behaviour also JS is used for animation and making page alive.
