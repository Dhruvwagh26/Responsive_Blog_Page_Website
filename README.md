# Responsive_Blog_Page_Website
This Project is the first Task assigned to me during my Internship at Dabotics India Pvt. Ltd.

Here I build Responsive Blog page with the help of HTML , CSS and JS. 
Here I have used HTML for Page layout markup, CSS for improving styling and 
achieving Responsive behaviour also JS is used for animation and making page alive.


Description ->

The project is a responsive blog page website created solely with HTML and CSS, 
without the use of JavaScript. HTML is utilized for structuring the page layout, 
while CSS is employed to enhance styling and achieve responsiveness across different 
devices. With HTML providing the foundation and CSS refining the aesthetics and 
responsiveness, the project offers a visually appealing and user-friendly platform for 
visitors to browse blog content. This demonstrates your proficiency in front-end 
web development and showcases your ability to create a functional and attractive 
website without relying on JavaScript for interactivity or animation.
